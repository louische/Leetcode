## Description
```
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

```
## Thought
```
Complete the problem withou using recursion. It is not difficult to find that post order traversal 
is actually the reverse of traversing root -> right -> left. For example: the postorder traversal of
    1
   /  \
  2    3
 / \  / \
4  5  6  7

is 4->5->2->6->7->3->1, which is exactly the reverse of 1->3->7->6->2->5->4. Therefore, the most of the code
is similar to the preorder traversal code, except for the order of traversing left and right.
```


## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def postorderTraversal(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if root is None:
            return []

        stack = root
        res = []
        while stack:
            root = stack.pop()
            res.append(root.val)
            if root.left is not None:
                stack.append(root.left)
            if root.right is not None:
                stack.append(root.right)
                
        return res[::-1]

```
