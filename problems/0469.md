## Description
```
Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex (Convex polygon definition).
Note:
There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.

## Thought
I have to admit I didn't knwo how to solve this problem until I found the solution online. To solve this problem, you need 
have some idea of the properties of cross products


## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def isConvex(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        def cross_prod(A, B, C):
            return (B[0] - A[0]) * (C[1] - A[1]) - \
                   (B[1] - A[1]) * (C[0] - A[0])
        # The rotation direction is determined when we calculate the first cross product
        # After that, when we found a triplets that has a cross product different from 
        # the first one, return false.
        sign = 0
        for i in range(len(points)):
            cur = cross_prod(points[i], points[(i + 1) % n], points[(i + 2) % n])
            if cur != 0:
                if cur * sign < 0:
                    return False
                else:
                    sign = cur
        return True

```
