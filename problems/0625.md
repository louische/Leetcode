## Thought
As we want to fit every single factor into a digit, the factor should be smaller or equal to 9.
Therefore, we divide the number by 9, 8, 7 ... until it has no factor left. We store every factor
along each division.

## Caveats:
We need to divide in descending order to avoid cases like getting two 3s instead of a 9.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestFactorization(self, a: int) -> int:
        if a < 10:return a
        factor = []
        for i in range(9, 1, -1):
            while a % i == 0:
                factor.append(str(i))
                a //= i
        if a != 1:return 0
        res = int("".join(factor[::-1]))
        return res if res < 2 ** 31 else 0
```
