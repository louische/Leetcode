## Description
```
Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

```
## Thought
```
Complete the problem withou using recursion. Basically, it is a BFS problem and 
therefore we can solve the problem using the property of stack. One thing to note is that 
as we are doing left first then right, we need to insert right child node into the stack
before inserting the left one.
```


## Code

```python
class Solution(object):
    def preorderTraversal(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if root is None:
            return []
        stack = [root]
        res = []
        
        while stack:
            root = stack.pop()
            if root is not None:
                output.append(root.val)
                if root.right is not None:
                    stack.append(root.right)
                if root.left is not None:
                    stack.append(root.left)
        
        return res

```
